My name is Julian Leland Bell. I'm a mechanical engineer, working at the intersection of robotics, manufacturing and precision engineering. I completed my B.S. at Swarthmore College (Engineering, 2012) and my M.S. at MIT (Mechanical Engineering, 2017). 

I currently work in the Advanced Technology Group at [UPS]({{"https://www.ups.com"}}), where I develop new robotic technologies for material handling and logistics. Before coming to UPS, I developed new metal additive manufacturing technologies in the Advanced R&D Group at [Desktop Metal]({{"https://www.desktopmetal.com/"}}); worked on automated construction systems with the [Mediated Matter Group]({{"http://matter.media.mit.edu/"}}) at the [MIT Media Lab]({{"https://www.media.mit.edu/"}}); and designed cable-driven robotic manipulators at [Barrett Technology]({{"https://www.barrett.com/"}}).

My scholarship has focused specifically on problems in manipulator design for construction automation, primarily through my work with the Digital Construction Platform. I've spoken to a wide range of audiences about my work, current developments in construction automation, and how these technologies promise to impact the AEC fields. My past speaking engagements include:
- [National Science Foundation Workshop on AM for Civil Infrastructure Design and Construction]({{"https://events.tti.tamu.edu/conference/nsf-3dp-workshop/"}})
- [American Conference of Construction Lawyers 29th Annual Meeting]({{"https://www.accl.org/"}})
- [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign Guest Lecture]({{"https://arch.illinois.edu/node/646"}})
