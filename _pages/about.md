My name is Ryan Grajewski. I'm a mechanical engineer with a passion for understanding and pushing the physical limits of the things around us. I am fascinated by the ways people interact with technology on a day-to-day basis, and I am driven to establish myself as a leader in that design space at the intersection of advanced robotics, manufacturing, and product development. 

I graduated from Georgia Tech with a B.S. in mechanical engineering in 2022, and chose to continue my education fruther into graduate school by pursuing GT's 5-year joint BS/MS pogram. I am currently completing the final semester of my M.S. degree in mechanical engineering where my program of study focuses on robotics, automation, and controls. I am anticipating graduation May 2023. 

I have experience from a number of roles in the design, manufacturing, and robotics industires, and most recently have worked for UPS's Advanced Technology Group in their Rapid Prototyping Lab. I have other experience in quality engineering in the aerospace industry from my time with Safran Data Systems inc, and am very comfortable with machine shop equipment after working as a shop apprentice for Pro-Type Industries inc. This website is my opportunity to display some of my other skills I've developed through my project work.
