My name is Ryan Grajewski. 

I'm a well-rounded mechanical engineer with a passion for understanding and pushing the physical limits of technology at the intersection of advanced robotics, manufacturing, and product development. My goal as a young professional is to hone my technical expertise, and establish myself as a leader in the high-tech industry where I may bridge the gap between my highly technical peers and the business oriented stakeholders invested in my projects.  

I graduated from the Georgia Institute of Technology with a B.S. in mechanical engineering in 2022, earning the highest honors academic distinction. In May 2023, I earned my masters degree in mechanical engineering also at Georgia Tech through the rigorous 5-year joint BS/MS program. My graduate scholarship has focused specifically on the combination of robotics, automation, and control systems.

I have experience from a number of roles in the design, manufacturing, and R&D industires, and most recently have worked for UPS's Advanced Technology Group in their Rapid Prototyping Lab. I have other experience in quality engineering in the aerospace industry from my time with Safran Data Systems inc, and am very comfortable with machine shop equipment after working as a shop apprentice for Pro-Type Industries inc. 

This website is my opportunity to display some of the other skills I've developed through my project work.
