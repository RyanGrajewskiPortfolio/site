After relying on the Swarthmore College Computing Society's largesse for _way_  too long after graduation, I've finally gotten a new website put together. Welcome!

I'll be slowly transitioning relevant content from my SCCS site to here over the next few months, with the goal of shutting down the SCCS site in December 2018. In the meantime, my work will still be available at [http://blogs.sccs.swarthmore.edu/julianleland/]({{"http://blogs.sccs.swarthmore.edu/julianleland/"}}).
