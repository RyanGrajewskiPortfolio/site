## Project Overview

This was the final project inspired by my group work in the undergraduate Fluid Dynamics class. The goal was to utilize our studies in fluid dynamics to develop an understanding of how varying the geometry of different weirs in a flume effect the flow of water. 

Weirs are small dam-like structure built along streams and canals that are useful in controlling the upstream flow of water and water level.
