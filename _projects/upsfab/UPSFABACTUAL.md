## Overview
Throughout my time as an R&D Mechanical Engineering intern at UPS, there were several high-priority, quick-turnaround projects that were given to me on top of my main project. I'm choosing to highlight these smaller projects because, in my eyes, the work done to get these projects from phonecall to working demo represents exactly the essence of rapid prototyping.

## Spot Robot Package Carrier - Turnaround: 4 days
There was a major UPS technology summit approaching, and the manager of the Robotics/AI Division met with our team about the idea of demoing the Boston Dynamics Spot Robot to the crowd by having it deliver food trays when it came time for the afternoon lunch recess. With a general concept and a few napkin sketches, I quickly CADed a design for the package carrier that would fit one of UPS's "smalls" sized packages and then immediatley went to use the Waterjet and 3D printer to cutout and form the components of the assembly. 

The package carrier was a hit when Spot arrived on stage with Chic Fil A lunch! Later on, the same package carrier was used again in UPS's Healthcare Conference, bringing boxes to and from mineature healthcare bulidings in an interactive demo. 

## Package Car Door Sensor Box - Turnaround 2 days
A member of the Data Analytics team had a clever idea for a way to mount a sensor onto a package car's roll-up door and wanted help fabricating the rough CAD model they had built. 

I was sent the CAD files and immediatley got to work, first waterjetting out sheetmetal plates and then using the handbrake to make the necessary bends that fit the drawings. I was able to collaborate with the data analyst on how to best assemble the hardware box and provide feedback on how to improve the design to decrease assembly time.

## Sliding Package Dividers - Turnaround 5 days
A team member was getting ready to leave UPS and was in a sprint to finish their main project -- one aspect of the project's design that had been overlooked were these sliding package dividers that were used to parition boxes inside a larger system. These dividers were having difficulty interacting with the larger system, and their sliding action was hampered by friction and poor track alignment. 

I dissected the divider's design and identified two core design areas that I thought would require improvement to mitigate our original concerns. I devised three possible design solutions and 3D Printed iterations of each to evaluate their performance. The final design uses an all-thread connecting rod between the two wheel mounts to tension the wheel faces against their guiderails.
