I interned for UPS's Advanced Technology Group as a R&D Mechanical Engineer from May 2022 through May 2023. 

At the start of my internship in May 2022, I was presented with the very open ended engineering challenge of devising and prototyping a system that would integrate with a larger package handling solution already in development. The problem that was presented to me was to build a system that could accept packages from the output of one system, scan/identify critical information on the package, manipulate the package's orientation, and then dispense them into the opening of the next system with high repeatability. My responsibility was to take these "it should do X" statements and fully articulate the scope of the system, define the functional requirements of the system, and design a working prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the system within the physical limits of the project. 

Over the three semesters I interned for UPS, I designed, fabricated, and demonstrated each of the core functionalities of my designed system. A Provisional Patent was filed on Feb 9, 2023 for this invention and I am named primary inventor. Unfortunately, I am limited in what aspects I am able to elaborate on since this project comprises some critical IP pertaining to one of UPS's newest package distribution technologies.

What I can talk about is my experience progressing through this cradle-to-grave project. My average day often entailed CADing conceptual design ideas and then walking them out into the shop to construct them with a Waterjet, CNC Mill, Cold Saw, Sheet Metal Bender, and 3D printer. 


I have had the incredible opportunity of extending my initial term as intern and have been working part time in this role for the past Fall 2022 semester and now Spring 2023. As of February 9, 2023, a provisional patent application has been filed for the system I developed as my main project. I am currently working with UPS to understand what details I can and cannot share.


More coming Soon.
