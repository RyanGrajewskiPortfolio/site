My main project for UPS's Advanced Technology Group has been the most exciting and enriching problem solving experience I have had the opportunity to be apart of. Because this project is ongoing and comprises critical IP for one of UPS's newest package distribution technologies, I am only allowed to share limited details of my work.

At the start of my internship in May 2022, I was presented with the very open ended engineering challenge of devising and prototyping a system that would integrate with a larger package handling solution already in development. The problem that was presented to me was to build a system that could accept packages from the output of one system, scan/identify critical information on the package, manipulate the package's orientation, and then dispense them into the opening of the next system with high repeatability. My responsibility was to take these "it should do X" statements and fully articulate the scope of the system, define the functional requirements of the system, and build a working prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the system within the physical limits of the project. 

I have had the incredible opportunity of extending my initial term as intern and have been working part time in this role for the past Fall 2022 semester and now Spring 2023. As of February 9, 2023, a provisional patent application has been filed for the system I developed as my main project. I am currently working with UPS to understand what details I can and cannot share.


More coming Soon.
