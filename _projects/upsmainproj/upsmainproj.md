## Overview
For my main project at UPS, I was presented the very open ended engineering challenge of conceptualizing and prototyping a system that would integrate with a larger package handilng solution already in development. The objective for the project was to build a system that could:
1.  accept packages from the output of one system,
2.  determine the package's orientation
3.  manipulate the package's orientation
4.  and then dispense the package into the opening of the next system with high repeatability.

My responsibility was to take these "it should do X" statements and fully articulate the scope of the system, conceptualize a system to satisfy the functional requirements, and build a working prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the system within the physical limits of the project.
