<span style="font-style:oblique"><b>Note</b>: because this project is still ongoing and comprises critical IP for one of UPS's newest package distribution technologies, I am only allowed to share limited details of my work.</span>

## Overview
For my main project at UPS, I was presented the very open ended engineering challenge of conceptualizing and prototyping a system that would integrate with a larger package handilng solution already in development. The objective for the project was to build a system that could:
1.  accept packages from the output of one system,
2.  scan/identify critical information on the package
3.  manipulate the package's orientation
4.  and then dispense the package into the opening of the next system with high repeatability.

My responsibility was to take these "it should do X" statements and fully articulate the scope of the system, conceptualize a system to satisfy the functional requirements, and build a working prototype to demonstrate the feasibility of the system within the physical limits of the project.

The system I developed is capable of accepting a package in any random orientation and, after a sequence of rotations, dispensing the package in a uniform desired orientation. The completed prototype has 5 total axes of motion, each driven individually by stepper motors via a series of custom drive mechanisms.

## Process 

I had the opportunity to develop this project for three full internship terms, having been given the opportunity to extend my original contract for Summer 2022 up through May 2023. At the beginning of each semester, I defined realistic goals for the project that I needed to achieve. These were:<br>
    -<span style="font-weight:550">Summer 2022</span>: Define functional requirements & explore design space, mathematically articulate the orientation problem, conceptualize in CAD the full system and its motions, begin prototyping the physical components (the first 3 motion axes)<br>
    -<span style="font-weight:550">Fall 2022</span>: Develop (4th motion axis) physical components, develop motor controller electronics module, and program rudimentary test sequences<br>
    -<span style="font-weight:550">Spring 2023</span>: Develop (5th motion axis) physical components, fully develop controller code to implement the logic algorithm, validate functionality with testing<br>

## Prototype Fabrication 

I have been given permission by UPS to display certain components of the final prototype that I designed and fabricated using the lab's first-class equipment like the OMAX waterjet, CNC Mill, industrial 3D Printer, and sheet-metal brake. For each of these mechanisms, I performed in-dept engineering calculations to inform the component design and ensure my system requirements were met.
